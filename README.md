# rust
Lyubomir Gavadinov created a course on Udemy called "Learn Rust by building Real Applications" which I signed up for after an intense focus on Python and AWS over the past several months. 
The creator of this course also has a heavy AWS background and found Rust just as useful as Javascript and C, and explains it the introduction that Rust has been voted the most loved programming language for the 5 years prior
to this course's publication.
I also saw some people on Twitter saying it will be the most in-demand programming language in 2024 and beyond, so without further ado, here is me seeing what the hype is about and building real apps with it. :)
